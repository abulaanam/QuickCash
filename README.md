# QuickCash

The "Quick Cash" project is a proposal from ABC Company aimed at developing a mobile application that connects users with small paid work opportunities in their local area. The project seeks to engage a skilled development team to explore the concept and interaction flow of the app, focusing on several key features for initial evaluation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the project components:

### Project Overview
- **Objective**: To create a mobile application that facilitates finding and offering small paid jobs locally.
- **Target Users**: The app will cater to two distinct user roles: employers (those offering jobs) and employees (those seeking jobs).

### Key Features
1. **Dynamic Location Detection**: The app will automatically identify the user's local area to provide relevant job listings.
  
2. **Job Types**: The application will define various small paid jobs, such as:
   - Computer repair
   - Lawn mowing
   - Dog walking
   - Babysitting
   - Grocery pickup

3. **User Roles**: 
   - Users can register as either an employer or an employee, with a clear separation in app design and functionality for each role.
   - Registration may involve providing credit card details for payment processing.

4. **Job Submission**: Employers can submit job postings with essential details, including:
   - Date and time
   - Expected duration
   - Urgency
   - Salary
   - Job location

5. **Job Search Functionality**: Employees can search for jobs based on various criteria, such as:
   - Job title
   - Salary range
   - Expected duration
   - Proximity to their location
   - Search results may be displayed on a Google map for easy navigation.

6. **User Preferences**: Users can save their preferences within the app, including:
   - Preferred job types
   - Preferred employers or employees

7. **Payment Integration**: The app will incorporate an online payment system (e.g., PayPal) to facilitate instant payments for completed jobs.

8. **Job Alerts**: Employees will receive notifications when jobs that match their preferences become available in their local area.

9. **Recommendations**: The app will suggest potential employees to employers based on the job postings they submit.

10. **User Ratings and History**: Users will be able to rate each other, and the app will visualize job history, income, and reputation metrics for both employers and employees.

### Conclusion
The "Quick Cash" project aims to create a user-friendly platform that streamlines the process of finding and offering small jobs, enhancing local employment opportunities. The development team will focus on the initial concept and interaction flow, ensuring that the app meets the needs of both employers and employees effectively.
